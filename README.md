# Simple Proctoring

Simple Proctoring is a web application that allows teachers or proctors to manage student exams with the ability to see and record their screen and webcam through the exam without any additional software.  
The app uses WebRTC technology to enable real-time communication between the student's browser and the proctor's browser. This makes it easy for teachers to monitor students during exams and ensure that they are not cheating.
